# Data Visualization - University Project

This repo will be used to store the data(csv files) needed for the IN3030 Data Visualization project. (2020)
The purpose of this project was to create a data visualization from a public dataset.

I have used the tweets from Donald Trump and Joe Biden to create a visualization and show how the tweets of these politicians have change over time. 
Python was used to transform the data and get the sentimental analysis from each tweet.
