_A brief sentence or two with links to data sources._
For this project I will use Python to extract data from Donald Trumps tweets using Twitter API. Then, I'll perform sentimental analysis on the comments so I can measure how individuals have reacted to his tweets. I will extract the location, username, gender and location from the using the Twitter's API.

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._

Data Visualization will allow us to see a timeline from when Donal Trump was running for president until now. Furthermore, data visualizations make it easier to identify potentials trends, patterns rather than looks at rows and columns.

Using a geographical map will allow us to see the states where he's more popular. Lastly, if we create an interactive chart we could see how different states have reacted to his tweets over a period of time.
